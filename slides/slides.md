<!--
Live coding of a simple turn-based game using a TypeScript NodeJS backend and a Typescript React frontend using the krmx library. Krmx is a custom WebSocket protocol specifically build for user-based applications such as turn based games with NodeJS backends and React frontends.

üåé Building a multiplayer board game

<!--
I work at Xebia as a Cloud Consultant. In my free time I'm a hobbyist game developer. I love boardgames and especially making them. Since I was a kid. During covid trying to combine cloud/internet with games. Resulted in some multiplayer games for a group of friends (b11 party) which was 'Mario Party'-ish.

# Board game
Let's start at the basis. What is a board game?

- Table and Players
- Players can look at the board state on the table (cards, pieces, dice, ect...)
- Players can take actions asynchronously
- Players have imperfect information of the board state

# Software Complexity
How well do multiplayer games align with development best practices?

| **Best Practice**    | **What we need**                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Co-located System    | ‚ùå Distributed System            |
| Stateless            | ‚ùå Stateful (hidden information) |
| Synchronous          | ‚ùå Asynchronous                  |
| Eventual Consistency | ‚ùå Realtime                      |

# Krmx
A network protocol for realtime multi-user interactions.


<v-clicks>

- Distributed System ‚úÖ: Uses a clients and server architecture out of the box
- Stateful ‚úÖ: Keeps track of all-knowing state (server) and per player state (client)
- Asynchronous ‚úÖ: Allows users to interact over time
- Realtime ‚úÖ: Informs users in realtime via WebSockets

- Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: Created by me

# Krmx Implementation
What is Krmx in its core?

- Server
- Client
- Event Emitter
- Store state at server
- WebSockets for realtime updates

# Krmx Protocol
Event Emitter at its core.

# Krmx Protocol - Events
It's all just events

```json5 {1|2|3|4|all}
{ type: string, payload: object }
{ type: "user/joined", payload: { username: "simon" } }
{ type: "user/linked", payload: { username: "simon" } }
{ type: "custom/create-spawned", payload: { class: "dragon", power: 10 } }
```

# Customization
Use middleware to add your own functionality.

# Live Coding!
Let's build a simple Krmx Server and Client setup.

- Krmx is a Protocol
- Reference implementation of client and server provided
- TypeScript
- React / Redux
