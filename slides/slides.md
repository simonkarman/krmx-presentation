<!--
Live coding of a simple turn-based game using a TypeScript NodeJS backend and a Typescript React frontend using the krmx library. Krmx is a custom WebSocket protocol specifically build for user-based applications such as turn based games with NodeJS backends and React frontends.

üåé Building a multiplayer board game

<!--
I work at Xebia as a Cloud Consultant. In my free time I'm a hobbyist game developer. I love boardgames and especially making them. Since I was a kid. During covid trying to combine cloud/internet with games. Resulted in some multiplayer games for a group of friends (b11 party) which was 'Mario Party'-ish.

# Board game
Let's start at the basis. What is a board game?

- Table and Players
- Players can look at the board state on the table (cards, pieces, dice, ect...)
- Players can take actions asynchronously
- Players have imperfect information of the board state

# Software Complexity
How well do multiplayer games align with development best practices?

| **Best Practice**    | **What we need**                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Co-located System    | ‚ùå Distributed System            |
| Stateless            | ‚ùå Stateful (hidden information) |
| Synchronous          | ‚ùå Asynchronous                  |
| Eventual Consistency | ‚ùå Realtime                      |

# Krmx
A network protocol for realtime multi-user interactions.


<v-clicks>

- Distributed System ‚úÖ: Uses a clients and server architecture out of the box
- Stateful ‚úÖ: Keeps track of all-knowing state (server) and per player state (client)
- Asynchronous ‚úÖ: Allows users to interact over time
- Realtime ‚úÖ: Informs users in realtime via WebSockets

- Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: Created by me
